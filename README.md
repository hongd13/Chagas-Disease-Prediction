# Chagas-Disease-Prediction

<i> This README file contains a comprehensive summary of the development process, results analysis, and key findings from the Jupyter Notebook. </i>

## Introduction
This machine-learning project aims to produce a 
classification model to detect the presence of Chagasâ€™ disease, using a domain 
centric dataset, containing linear B-cell epitope readings captured by state-of-the-art technology, remarked by its high-dimensional data space and complexity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Preliminary Data Pre-processing
The initial inspection of the dataset shows that the dataset consists of 10 information columns, 1281 (1291 - 10) feature variables and 49606 total entries. All feature variables are in the float-64 datatypes, and there is a significant class imbalance within the dataset.

### Dataset splitting with Info_cluster

The dataset manual specifies that entries sharing the same **Info_cluster** label should be grouped during the train-test split and cross-validation processes. Analysing the population and class distribution of each Info_cluster label reveals an imbalance; some clusters are solely composed of class -1 entries, while others feature an excessive number of class 1 entries, and some contain significantly more entries than others. These characteristics and constraints introduce difficulties and complexities that need to be addressed when performing any form of dataset-splitting operations.

### Missing values

Upon checking for missing values, we see that **`feat_esm1b_148`** is missing in almost all entries (44655 entries) while counts of missing values for every other feature appear to be rather consistent, all ranging from 75 to 88, as shown below. 

<div align="center">

  ||Counts of NaN|
  |-|-|
  |feat_esm1b_148|44655|
  |feat_esm1b_646|88|
  |...|...|
  |feat_esm1b_257|75|
  |...|...|
  |Class|0|
  
</div>

In further investigation, it appears that there is no clear correlation between the **`Class`** distribution and the missing **`feat_esm1b_148`** values. As shown below, roughly 90% of the observations are missing the feature, where no noteworthy correlations between the class labels were visible. Therefore, it is possible to safely dismiss this feature as redundant and remove it.

  | Class                |   -1  |   1  |
  |----------------------|-------|------|
  | feat_esm1b_148_nan   |       |      |
  | False (not missing)  |  4875 |  76  |
  | True (missing)       | 43922 | 733  |
